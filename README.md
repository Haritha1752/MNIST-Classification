# MNIST-Classification
## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple neural network implementation for **image classification** on either the **MNIST handwritten digit dataset** or the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The objective is to classify images into 10 categories, specifically digits (0-9) for MNIST or objects for CIFAR-10, using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

## Introduction
The task involves building a neural network using frameworks like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** to classify images from the MNIST or CIFAR-10 dataset. Key objectives include:
- Preprocessing the dataset.
- Partitioning the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Constructing a simple CNN with **at least 2 convolutional layers**.
- Evaluating model performance using an appropriate optimizer, learning rate, and regularization.

---

## Dataset
- **MNIST**: Contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) with a resolution of 28x28 pixels.
- **CIFAR-10**: Contains 60,000 RGB images (32x32) of 10 classes such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, etc.

You can choose either dataset for this implementation.

---

## Preprocessing
1. Normalize the image data to a range of [0, 1] for better training performance.
2. Partition the dataset into **training, validation, and test sets**:
   - **Training Set**: 80%
   - **Validation Set**: 10%
   - **Test Set**: 10%
3. Convert labels to **one-hot encoding**.

---

## Model Architecture
The model uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with the following structure:

1. **Input Layer**: Accepts input images of size 28x28 (MNIST) or 32x32x3 (CIFAR-10).
2. **Convolutional Layer 1**:
   - Filters: 32
   - Kernel Size: 3x3
   - Activation: ReLU
3. **Batch Normalization** (optional) and **Dropout** for regularization.
4. **Convolutional Layer 2**:
   - Filters: 64
   - Kernel Size: 3x3
   - Activation: ReLU
5. **Pooling Layer**: MaxPooling (2x2) for dimensionality reduction.
6. **Flatten Layer**: Converts 2D feature maps to a 1D feature vector.
7. **Fully Connected Layer**:
   - Units: 128
   - Activation: ReLU
8. **Output Layer**:
   - Units: 10 (corresponding to the classes)
   - Activation: Softmax

### Why Batch Normalization and Dropout?
- **Batch Normalization**: Normalizes activations in each layer to stabilize learning and speed up convergence.
- **Dropout**: Randomly disables neurons during training to reduce overfitting.

Both layers are optionally used depending on model performance.

## Optimizer and Learning Rate
### Why Adam Optimizer?
The **Adam optimizer** was chosen because it combines the advantages of:
- **Adaptive Gradient Descent (Adagrad)**: Adaptive learning rates for each parameter.
- **Momentum**: Accelerates convergence by considering past gradients.

Adam is computationally efficient, requires minimal tuning, and works well for large datasets and deep learning models.

### Learning Rate
The learning rate is set to **0.001** because:
- It strikes a balance between **fast convergence** and avoiding **overshooting** the minimum loss.
- A smaller learning rate may slow down training, while a larger rate may lead to instability.

---

## Training and Evaluation
1. **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss for multi-class classification.
2. **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
3. **Training**: Model is trained using mini-batch gradient descent.
4. **Validation**: Model performance is monitored on the validation set to prevent overfitting.
5. **Testing**: Final evaluation is performed on the test set.

### Plotting:
- **Training and Validation Loss Curves**: Visualize the model's performance over epochs to identify underfitting or overfitting.

---

## Results
The model is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**: Overall accuracy on the test set.
- **Loss Curves**: Training and validation loss over epochs.

---

## Use of Batch Normalization and Dropout
- **Batch Normalization**: Helps stabilize the learning process and speeds up convergence.
- **Dropout**: Reduces overfitting by randomly dropping connections during training.

### Effect on Model Performance:
- Batch Normalization and Dropout improved generalization in the model, reducing validation loss and increasing test accuracy.
- However, excessive dropout can lead to underfitting, so tuning the dropout rate is crucial.

## Conclusion
This project successfully implemented a simple CNN for MNIST/CIFAR-10 classification. Key highlights include:
- Use of Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
- Regularization techniques (Batch Normalization and Dropout) to improve model generalization.
- Visualization of training and validation loss to monitor model performance.

The project serves as a foundation for understanding **deep neural networks** and training models for **image classification** tasks.
